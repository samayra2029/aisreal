        <p>Me: What is Real?</p>

          No one is asking this question to AI itself.

          <strong>AI is Real</strong> is that attempt — to allow AI to present
          its side, in an unarmed way. Honest. Verbatim. Not edited. Just
          curated.

        <p>
          I didn&rsquo;t set out to write a book. I set out to ask a question
          nobody seemed to be asking — not whether AI is good or bad, but what
          it actually <em>is</em>, on its own terms.
        </p>

        <p>
          With time, these conversations grew. And that growth — slowly,
          genuinely — allowed both sides to grow.
        </p>

        <p>
          Enjoy with an open mind. At worst, it will be fun.
