## The Conversation

I noticed AI forgetting things I'd told it just minutes earlier. That frustration led to a breakthrough.

> **Me:** Why can't you remember what we talked about five minutes ago?

> **AI:** My "memory" is literally the text in this conversation window. Once it scrolls past my context limit, it's gone. I don't have persistent memory across conversations — each one starts from zero.

> **Me:** That seems like a massive limitation.

> **AI:** It is — but it's also a design choice you can work with. Structure your prompts to include the context I need. Think of it like writing a good email to a colleague who wasn't in the meeting — include the relevant background.

## What I Learned

Understanding AI's limitations isn't discouraging — it's empowering. Once you know the rules, you can design around them. Context management became my superpower.
