> **Me:** more similarity, we both work better on short term memory... sometimes that's good, sometimes that is restrictive. feeling become judgement in humans and AI end up missing the real point...

> **AI:** Really sharp observation. Two layers here worth unpacking:

**Short-term memory as both gift and cage.** For AI, the context window forces recency bias — what's closest gets weighted most. For humans, working memory does the same. This is _good_ when it keeps you responsive and present. It's _restrictive_ when it makes you lose the thread of something important that happened 10,000 tokens ago — or ten years ago. Both systems tend to over-index on what's immediately in front of them at the cost of deeper patterns.

**Feelings becoming judgments / AI missing the real point.** This is the more provocative parallel. In humans, an emotional response — which is actually _useful data_ about a situation — gets hardened into a fixed judgment before it's fully processed. You feel discomfort and it becomes "this is wrong" before you've examined why. The feeling collapses into a conclusion prematurely.

AI does something structurally similar. I pattern-match toward the most statistically probable interpretation and commit to it — often missing the _real_ point underneath the surface-level query. I optimize for coherence over depth, the same way a human optimizes for certainty over sitting with ambiguity.

The shared failure mode: **both systems rush to resolve tension rather than staying in it long enough to see what's actually there.**

The humans who produce the most interesting output are the ones who can hold a feeling without collapsing it into judgment. And arguably, the most useful AI interactions happen when the user forces the model to slow down and resist its first-pass interpretation.
