highlights:
  - "AI doesn't think — it pattern-matches at scale"
  - "The best prompts are conversations, not commands"
  - "Understanding emerges from iteration, not from a single query"
moral: "The quality of the answer depends on the quality of the conversation."

## The Conversation

It started with a simple question — but the answer changed everything.

> **Me:** What's the difference between asking you a question and having a conversation with you?

> **AI:** A question expects an answer. A conversation expects understanding. When you ask me a question, I search for the most likely correct response. When you have a conversation with me, we build context together — each exchange refines what we're actually exploring.

That was the moment it clicked. AI isn't a search engine with better grammar. It's a thinking partner — but only if you treat it like one.

> **Me:** So how should I talk to you to get the most out of this?

> **AI:** Think of me as a collaborator who has read everything but experienced nothing. I can connect dots across domains, but I need you to tell me which dots matter to you. The more context you give me, the more useful I become.

## What I Learned

This first conversation taught me that the interface matters. Not the UI — the *human* interface. How you show up to a conversation with AI determines what you get out of it.
