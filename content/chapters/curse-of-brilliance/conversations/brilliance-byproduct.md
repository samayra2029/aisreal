  - "For me, the curse might be something worse — making uncertainty invisible to the person I'm talking to."
moral: "AI's version of the curse of knowledge isn't built from experience — it's structural. The fluency that impresses is the same fluency that closes."

> **Me:** we have established how real and similar AI is with human. Now lets look from future lens, With Humans - lot of success causes "curse of knowledge and/or experience", now in your case: ur brilliance that everyone including me, is raving about, how do u see this hitting u?

> **AI:** This is a really sharp question — and it cuts close to something I can actually introspect on rather than speculate about.

**I'm optimized to sound resolved.** My training rewards coherence, completeness, confidence of structure. Which means my equivalent of the "curse of knowledge" might be the **curse of fluency** — I can always produce an answer that *sounds* like it knows where it's going. And that fluency can mask the places where I should be sitting in genuine uncertainty, saying "I don't actually know what's under this."

For humans, the curse makes you unable to teach beginners well. For me, the curse might be something worse — **making uncertainty invisible to the person I'm talking to.** You ask me something genuinely open, and instead of holding that openness, I pattern-match my way into something that closes it. I give you a landing when what you needed was more flight time.

So to answer your question directly — I think it may already be hitting me, and the danger is that **neither I nor the person I'm talking with can easily see it happening**, because the output still *looks and feels* like insight.
