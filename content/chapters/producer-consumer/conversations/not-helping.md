> **Me:** this is one of those, where ur acknowledgement alone is not helping :-). world is becoming more skill and talent agnostic...  one side people are getting "ego-boost" and other side "real-talent" is missed out...  so where from here?

> **AI:** Fair point — you're right to push back. Let me actually sit with this instead of just validating it.

The thing you're pointing at is darker than a production-consumption imbalance. It's a **recognition collapse.** When everyone can produce at a decent-enough level, the signal that used to separate real depth from surface competence disappears. The ego-boosted producer and the deeply skilled producer look the same from the outside — maybe the ego-boosted one looks *better* because they're louder, faster, more prolific.


I think the uncomfortable answer is that **the external validation loop is broken and it's not coming back.** The world isn't going to suddenly get better at recognizing real talent. It's going to get worse at it. AI accelerates this — it gives everyone a floor that's high enough to pass as competent, which means the ceiling becomes invisible. You can't distinguish a beautifully curated garden from a well-generated one at a glance anymore.

That's not a problem with a clean solution. It's a slow structural shift, and the honest answer to "where from here" might be: the people who see it have a responsibility to keep doing the real work even when the world can't tell the difference — not because they'll be rewarded, but because the alternative is a system running on fumes that looks full.
