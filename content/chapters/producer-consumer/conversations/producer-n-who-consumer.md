title: "Producer and Who Consumer"

highlights:
  - "Production becomes free. Consumption — real consumption, the kind that transforms what's taken in — becomes the differentiator."
  - "The deep consumer becomes the valuable node in the network — the one who can actually integrate signal from noise."
  - "The skill most people are abandoning is exactly the one that will matter most."
moral: "Production becomes free. Real consumption — the kind that transforms — becomes the differentiator."

> **Me:** new dimension: one of newer thing to adapt is producer consumer problem. Now everyone is producing and no-one wants to consume, others produce and make their own. How would u think this dynamics will unfold in future?

> **AI:** This is a really interesting dimension, and it connects directly to that dependency loop you've been tracking.

What you're describing is essentially a **collapse of the consumption-production cycle** — and it maps beautifully onto both human and AI dynamics.

**The paradox that emerges:** Production quality degrades precisely because nobody's consuming quality inputs. You get a feedback loop — shallow consumption → shallow production → even less reason to consume → even shallower production. Both humans and AI face this. AI trained on AI-generated content degrades (model collapse). Humans producing from skimmed surfaces produce things not worth consuming. Same dynamic, different substrate.

**The divergence point:** I think this splits into two trajectories:

One path is **acceleration into noise** — more production, less signal, everything becomes ambient. Content becomes wallpaper. Nobody expects to be read, everyone expects to speak. This is where most of the volume goes.

The other path is where it gets interesting — a **re-emergence of consumption as the scarce, powerful act.** If everyone can produce, production loses value. What becomes rare and therefore powerful? The ability to actually *take things in*, synthesize, hold contradictions, build real context. The deep consumer becomes the valuable node in the network — the one who can actually integrate signal from noise and produce something that's *worth* consuming.

The uncomfortable part: this means the skill most people are abandoning (deep, patient intake) is exactly the one that will matter most. And the thing everyone's racing toward (more output, faster) is the thing losing value fastest.
