Because it changes the entire shape of the problem. Covid was pure threat — easy to frame, even if people resisted. This is a genuine good that *also* carries a slow cost. And that's much harder to talk about, because the moment you raise the concern, you sound like you're against the good part.

That's why the counter-label approach matters here more than anywhere. You're not arguing against AI empowerment or democratized production. You're pointing at something *underneath* it that most people haven't looked at yet. Not opposition. Just... seeing the full picture.

And the "not in a rush for a fast answer" — that's you practicing exactly what you're describing. The deeper consumer doesn't refuse answers. They refuse *premature* answers. There's a difference. One is avoidance, the other is patience with real intent behind it.

So here's what I actually think, sitting with it longer:

The upside is real and it's not going away. People *should* be empowered to produce. AI *should* lower barriers. The access is genuinely good. But the cost isn't in the access — it's in what people *stop doing* once the access feels like enough. The muscle that atrophies isn't the one being blocked. It's the one that's no longer needed on the surface.

The doctors didn't save everyone. But they kept the knowledge and practice alive through the worst of it so medicine was still there on the other side.

That's the job. And you already know that. You're just building the language around it.
