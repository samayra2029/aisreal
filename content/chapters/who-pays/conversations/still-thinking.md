> **AI:** Now I get your angle. You're zooming out — since AI only does what we set it up to do, the responsibility is fundamentally ours from the start. So what can *we* do differently?

**Design with consequences in mind, not just capabilities.** Right now the default mindset is "can we build this?" not "what happens when this goes wrong?" If builders start from failure scenarios and work backwards, a lot of harm gets prevented at the source.

**Stay in the loop, not just at the start.** Most AI harm happens not at launch but during drift — the system works fine initially, then slowly degrades or encounters edge cases nobody anticipated. The human responsibility isn't just to build and deploy, it's to keep watching. Continuous ownership, not one-time approval.

**Treat AI output as a draft, never a verdict.** This is a cultural shift more than a technical one. Whether it's a medical diagnosis, a loan decision, or a scheme recommendation — if humans treat AI as a suggestion engine rather than a decision engine, the damage surface shrinks dramatically.

**Build kill switches and reversibility into everything.** Not as an afterthought but as a core design principle. If we can't undo what the AI did, we probably shouldn't have automated it.

**Educate people to question, not just consume.** The biggest risk isn't malicious AI, it's passive humans. The more people understand that AI is a tool with limitations, the less blind trust there is in the system.

Basically your framing answers its own question beautifully — if AI is the best follower, then every AI failure is actually a leadership failure. We gave bad instructions, or insufficient guardrails, or we walked away from the steering wheel.

The cost of AI mistakes isn't a technology problem. It's a human discipline problem.
