So yeah — the accountability gap is real. When AI messes up, the cost falls on a messy chain of humans:

**The builders** — companies that designed and deployed it. Most emerging regulation (EU AI Act, etc.) points here first.

**The deployers** — organizations that chose to use it in a specific context. If a bank uses an AI model for loan decisions and it discriminates, the bank can't just blame the vendor.

**The users** — if you blindly trust AI output without any verification, there's some personal responsibility too.

**And sometimes… the victims themselves** — this is the ugly part. When no one takes ownership, the person harmed just absorbs the cost. No recourse, no compensation.

The deeper issue is that AI diffuses responsibility so well that everyone can point at someone else. The developer says "we provided guidelines," the deployer says "we followed them," the user says "I trusted the system." And the person who got hurt is left holding the bag.

It's essentially a **accountability vacuum** — and historically, those vacuums only get filled after enough damage forces regulation. We saw it with cars, pharmaceuticals, social media. AI is on the same trajectory, just moving faster.

The real question might not be "who pays" but "who *should* pay" — and whether we'll set that up proactively or only after enough people get burned.
